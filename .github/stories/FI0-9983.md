User Story
As an exporter,

I need to be able to provide relevant transport information

So that my IUU documentation is complete and prevent delays during import checks.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

Acceptance Criteria
## ✅ Scenario 1 - Container identification number exists

Given I have navigated to /add-transportation-details-truck on my Catch Certificate manual landing / file upload user journey

When the page loads

Then the field ‘Container identification number (optional)' exists underneath the ‘Truck registration' field

And the field guidance text underneath the field label is ‘Enter container or trailer identification number. For example, ABCD1234567.’

And the field is optional

And the field is free text

**Implementation Notes:**
**Front end**
- Add field `containerIdentificationNumber` to the transportation details,`add-transportation-details-truck/` form as optional field in same ways as other optional fields
- Add guidance text underneath the field label is ‘Enter container or trailer identification number. For example, ABCD1234567.’

**Back end**
On the back end, `mmo-fes-orchestration`
- Add the new `containerIdentificationNumber` in the same way as other optional fields are added e.g., `freightBillNumber`
- Add unit tests to cover the new field where applicable

## ✅ Scenario 2 - Container identification number not populated

Given I have navigated to /add-transportation-details-truck on my Catch Certificate manual landing / file upload user journey

When I have not populated container identification number

And all other mandatory fields are completed

And I press ‘Save and continue’

Then I am navigated to the next page and no errors are shown

And the details are saved to the application

Given I have navigated to /add-transportation-details-truck on my Catch Certificate manual landing / file upload user journey

And I press ‘Save and continue’

Then I see a field-level error of ‘Container identification number must not exceed 150 characters’

And the error is shown in the error summary section at the top of the page

And the details are not saved to the application

**Implementation Notes:**
**Front end**
- Added error `ccContainerIdentificationNumberMaxLength`: "Container identification number must not exceed 150 characters" (EN)

Then I see a field-level error of ‘Container identification number must only contain letters, numbers and spaces’

And the error is shown in the error summary section at the top of the page

And the details are not saved to the application
