## FIO-10474 - Landing page date validation and vessel name error (Direct landing)

### Summary

When a user creates a Catch Certificate and uses the "Direct landing" flow, entering invalid dates on the landing page should show the correct validation errors. Additionally there is a repro showing an extra vessel-name error that does not occur in the manual-landing path; this story captures the expected behaviour and acceptance criteria for investigation and fixing.

### Acceptance criteria

Given I have created a Catch Certificate

And I choose "Direct landing"

And I navigate to the landing page

And I enter all required fields with valid values

When I modify the "Start Date" and "Date Landed" to invalid values

Then I should see an error message indicating invalid dates

And there is no additional error message for Vessel name 

Notes
- The additional vessel-name error is observed in the Direct landing flow but is NOT observed when using the manual landing flow. The backend/frontend behaviour should be investigated and corrected so that:
  - Date validation errors display correctly for invalid Start Date and Date Landed
  - No spurious vessel-name error is shown when Vessel name is valid

### Repro steps (high level)
1. Create a Catch Certificate (or use a fixture/test case that results in an editable catch certificate)
2. Choose the Direct landing option
3. Go to the landing page
4. Fill all required fields with valid values
5. Change Start Date and Date Landed to invalid values (e.g. non-date or out-of-range)
6. Submit or blur the field to trigger validation
7. Observe date validation errors; observe any vessel-name error

### Acceptance tests
- Add/extend Cypress test(s) to cover the Direct landing path validating:
  - Invalid Start Date shows the correct date error message
  - Invalid Date Landed shows the correct date error message
  - Vessel name error is not present when Vessel name is valid
