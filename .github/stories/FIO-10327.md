# FIO-10327 — Point of destination on Check Your Answers

User Story
---------
As an exporter

I need to be able to provide point of destination

So that my document complies with EU regulations

Summary
-------
Add the "Point of destination" field to the Check your information / Check your answers page for non-manipulation document journeys. The field must appear under the existing "Consignment destination" / "Destination country" field in the "Departure from storage facility" section. The field should show the saved value and include a Change link which navigates back to the relevant transportation details page for the current transport mode.

Acceptance Criteria
-------------------

Scenario 1 - Point of destination exists on Check Your Answers page

Given I have navigated to `/check-your-information` on my non-manipulation document user journey

When the page loads

Then the field `Point of destination` exists underneath the `Consignment destination` field in the `Departure from storage facility` section

And the field `Point of destination` has a Change link

And the Change link navigates back to the field on `/add-transportation-details-<mode of transport>` (mode-specific route)

Scenario 2 - Update or Retain Point of Destination value after using Change link

Given I am on the `/what-are-you-exporting` (or `/what-export-journey`) page after selecting the Change link for Point of Destination from the Check Your Information page

When I update the Point of Destination value

And select Save and Continue

Then I should be redirected back to the `/check-your-information` page

And the updated Point of Destination value should be displayed under the Destination Country field.

But when I make no change to the Point of Destination value

And select Save and Continue

Then I should be redirected back to the `/check-your-information` page

And the previously saved Point of Destination value should be retained and displayed as before.

Scenario 3 - Non-JS

Given I have navigated to `/check-your-information` on my non-manipulation document user journey

When JavaScript is turned off

Then the page must be fully functional and compliant with non-JavaScript behaviour (server-side rendering and validation, links work without JS, and the Change link still navigates correctly)

Scenario 4 - Accessibility

Given I have navigated to `/check-your-information` on my non-manipulation document user journey

Then the page must be compliant with GDS accessibility guidelines (correct heading structure, accessible Change link, error summary role/behaviour, keyboard focus, screen-reader friendly labels)

Developer notes
---------------
- Add the `Point of destination` display to the `Check your information` page in the `Departure from storage facility` section. Reuse existing templates for review pages.
- The Change link should include the mode of transport context and navigate to the correct transport mode route, e.g. `/create-storage-document/:documentNumber/add-transportation-details-truck` or the equivalent catch-certificate route for catch certificate journeys.
- When the Change link is used, the user returns to the relevant transportation details page where they can edit the `Point of destination` value. On Save and Continue the user returns to the check page and the value is persisted (or retained if unchanged).
- Ensure server-side handling preserves the previously saved value when the user makes no change.
- Non-JS: ensure the Change link is an anchor that works without client-side routing; check server-side redirects preserve next-uri where needed.
- Accessibility: ensure the field label and value are readable by screen readers and the Change link has a clear accessible name (for example: "Change point of destination").

QA checklist
------------
- [ ] `Point of destination` is visible under `Consignment destination` in `Departure from storage facility` on `/check-your-information` for all non-manipulation journeys.
- [ ] The `Change` link exists and navigates to the correct `/add-transportation-details-<mode>` route for each transport mode.
- [ ] Updating the value via the Change link persists the new value on Save and Continue and shows it on `/check-your-information`.
- [ ] Leaving the value unchanged and saving retains the previous value.
- [ ] Behaviour works when JavaScript is disabled (links and server-side saves/redirects operate correctly).
- [ ] Page meets GDS accessibility checks (heading hierarchy, error summary role, focus management, readable labels).

Notes / follow-ups
------------------
- Confirm the exact route name used after the Change link for each journey (catch-certificate vs storage-document route prefixes) so the Change link implementation matches existing route patterns.
- Confirm whether the Check your information page should show the label `Point of destination` or a shorter/translated label in other contexts.
