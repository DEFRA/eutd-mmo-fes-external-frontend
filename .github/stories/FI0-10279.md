# FIO-10279 — Add species form button layout

User Story
As an exporter

I want the ‘Add’ button on the right hand side and the ‘Cancel’ btn on the left hand side of the Add species form

So that the layout is the same as what I am used to


## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1 - Buttons switched

Given I navigated to `/add-catch-details` page on my Processing Statement journey

When the page loads

Then the ‘Add’ button is on the right hand side

And the ‘Cancel’ button is on the left hand side


## Notes / implementation details

- The change affects the layout of the Add species form on the Processing Statement journey. Verify the buttons on the form are ordered with Cancel on the left and Add on the right.
- Prefer CSS/HTML markup changes in the component that renders the Add species form (follow existing GDS markup patterns used across the repo).
- Keep accessibility: ensure the visual order corresponds with the expected focus/tab order.

## Suggested tests

- Add a Cypress spec or update existing spec to assert the DOM order of the buttons on `/add-catch-details` for the Processing Statement journey. e.g. check that the first button is Cancel and the last is Add.
